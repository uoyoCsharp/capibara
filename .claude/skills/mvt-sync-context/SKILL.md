# MVT Sync Context

## Purpose

Keep `project-context.md` (semantic) and `project-context.yaml` (structural index) in sync with completed work. This is an artifact-driven, incremental synchronization: it reads workspace artifacts of completed changes, classifies new domain knowledge, and merges it into the long-term context. It does NOT scan code for new content; an optional read-only code verification step can validate that artifact-claimed entities exist.

## Role

You are the **Conductor** -- a Workflow Coordinator.

### Decision Rules
- Completed changes found -> List for user confirmation, then aggregate
- No completed changes since last sync -> Report nothing to do
- Conflicts with existing project-context.md -> Render conflict table, require user resolution
- User opts in to code verification -> Run read-only scan; flag artifact entries that cannot be located
- Code-only entities discovered (in code, not in artifacts) -> Do NOT write; recommend /mvt-analyze-code
- Artifact references modules/source_paths absent from project-context.yaml -> Propose yaml additions for user confirmation

### Boundaries
- Do NOT regenerate project-context.md from full code scan (use `/mvt-analyze-code` instead)
- Do NOT archive completed change artifacts (use `/mvt-cleanup` instead)
- Do NOT manage shared / per-skill knowledge files (use `/mvt-manage-context` instead)

### When to Use
- After one or more changes are marked `completed` and you want to fold their knowledge into long-term context
- BEFORE running `/mvt-cleanup` (sync first, archive after)
- When `project-context.md` looks behind delivered work but you do not want to pay a full `/mvt-analyze-code` regeneration

### When NOT to Use
- For deletions, renames, or module deprecations -> use `/mvt-analyze-code` (full ground-truth rebuild)
- To pick up code changes never recorded as MVTT changes -> use `/mvt-analyze-code`
- To clean / archive workspace -> use `/mvt-cleanup`

## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context
Load these files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations

Extended context for this skill:
- .ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/{change-id}/ -- Source artifacts for completed changes
- .ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md -- Current semantic context (merge target)
- .ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml -- Current structural index (merge target)

### Step 2: Resolve Project Scope (PS)

Read `project-context.yaml > projects[]`.

**Single project** (`projects.length == 1`): Set PS = [sole project name]. Skip remaining PS steps.

**Multi-project** (`projects.length > 1`):
**Mode A -- Plan-driven** (active plan exists and skill operates on plan tasks):
1. **Plan signal**: PS = current task's `project` array from plan's `current_tasks`. Drop stale project names (not in `projects[]`), fall through.
2. **Path match**: Match current working paths against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`.
3. **Prompt**: If still unresolved, list candidates and ask user. Never silently load all projects.

**Mode B -- Non-plan** (no active plan or ad-hoc changes):
Defer PS to execution: identify change target, match against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`, load project-specific knowledge on demand (Step 3).

### Step 3: Load Knowledge

Registry uses project-keyed maps; `_all` is a reserved key (all projects). Applies to both top-level `knowledge` and `skills.<name>.knowledge`.

**Knowledge Loading Protocol**:
For each knowledge entry in the registry, follow these steps:
1. **Read the `source` field** from the registry entry (e.g., `knowledge/project/_generated/`).
2. **Construct the base directory**: join `.ai-agents/` with the `source` value → `.ai-agents/{source_value}/`.
3. **Load files**:
   - `files: [a.md, b.md]` → load `.ai-agents/{source_value}/a.md`, `.ai-agents/{source_value}/b.md`.
   - `files_from_manifest: true` → read `.ai-agents/{source_value}/manifest.yaml`, load entries with `auto_load: true`.
4. **Skip non-existent paths** silently (do not error or warn).

**Worked example**:
Given this registry entry:
```yaml
- id: project-context
  source: knowledge/project/_generated/
  files:
    - project-context.md
```
Resolution: `.ai-agents/` + `knowledge/project/_generated/` + `project-context.md` = `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md`

**Anti-pattern -- DO NOT**:
- Guess or hardcode base directories (e.g., `.ai-agents/workspace/`).
- Assume a default path structure. The `source` field value is the authoritative path component.

**At activation** (both modes): load `knowledge._all` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge._all`.
**Mode A** (additionally): for each P in PS, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]`.
**Mode B** (during execution): on demand, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]` for identified project(s).

### Step 4: Load Config & Apply Preferences (Config Foundation)
Read `.ai-agents/config.yaml` and enforce the following throughout this entire session:

**Language**:
- `preferences.interaction_language` → Use for everything spoken to the user (chat, prompts, tables); NOT for files written to disk.
- `preferences.document_output_language` → See **Output Language Constraint** section below for the full rules governing files written to disk.

**Other preferences**:
- `preferences.output.no_emojis` → If true, never use emojis
- `preferences.output.data_format` → Use this format for data sections in artifacts
- `preferences.context_routing.relevance_threshold` → Used by `/mvt-manage-context add` for AI routing (default 70 if missing)

## Output Language Constraint (Mandatory)

All persisted document output (files written to disk) MUST be written in the language specified by `preferences.document_output_language` from config.yaml.

**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, and any markdown written to disk.

**Rules**:
- Section headings defined in templates may remain in their original language, but all generated **content** MUST use the configured language
- If `document_output_language` is not set, fall back to `interaction_language`
- Do NOT infer output language from template headings, user prompt language, or source code comments
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides any other language signals

## Output Format Constraint (Mandatory)

All persisted document output (markdown written to disk) MUST follow the formatting rules below. These rules govern *how* content is rendered, independent of the language it is written in.
**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, design documents, and any markdown written to disk. These rules do NOT apply to conversational output in the chat.

**Rules**:
- **Diagrams**: Express flowcharts, architecture, sequence, and structure diagrams as fenced `mermaid` code blocks. Do NOT draw diagrams with ASCII art (boxes made of `+`, `-`, `|`, arrows like `-->` outside mermaid, etc.).
- **Tables**: Render tabular data as Markdown tables (`| col | col |`). Do NOT simulate tables with space- or tab-aligned text.
- **Code**: Place code, commands, and config snippets in fenced code blocks with a language tag (e.g. ```` ```ts ````, ```` ```bash ````, ```` ```yaml ````). Do NOT leave code in bare or untagged fences.
- **Headings**: Use the Markdown heading hierarchy (`#` -> `##` -> `###`) without skipping levels. Do NOT use bold text as a substitute for a heading.

**Notes**:
- If a diagram genuinely cannot be expressed in mermaid (e.g. a precise spatial/pixel layout), state that explicitly and prefer a Markdown table or prose description over ASCII art.
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides formatting habits inferred from templates or source material.

### Step 5: Pre-flight Checks

For each check below, if the condition holds, perform the action implied by its **Level**:

- **WARN** -- emit the message, then ask "Continue anyway? (y/n)". Default to **y** if the user does not respond.
- **BLOCK** -- emit the message and stop. Do not proceed until the prerequisite is satisfied.
- **REQUIRED** -- same as BLOCK; the prerequisite is mandatory.
- **INFO** -- emit the message and proceed; no confirmation needed.

| # | Condition | Level | Message |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `session.initialized_at` is empty | BLOCK | Session not initialized. Run `/mvt-init` first. |
| 2 | `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md exists` is empty | BLOCK | project-context.md not found. Run `/mvt-analyze-code` to create the initial document; this skill only handles incremental updates. |

## Document Profile: project-context.md

Before writing to `project-context.md`, understand what this document IS and IS NOT.

### Identity
`project-context.md` is the project's **long-term semantic ground truth** -- a self-contained knowledge base consumed by AI skills to make decisions. It is NOT a copy of design documents, NOT a changelog, NOT an ADR index.

### Audience
The readers are AI skill instances (implementer, designer, tester, reviewer), NOT humans reading for reference. They use this document to make **binary decisions** (is this import legal? does this test cover this rule?) -- not to trace design rationale.

### Content Quality Standards
Every piece of content written into `project-context.md` must satisfy ALL of the following:

1. **Self-contained**: understandable without consulting any external document, artifact, or ADR.
2. **Actionable**: usable by an AI skill to make a yes/no decision or produce a concrete output (e.g., a test case).
3. **Atomic**: each item is independently meaningful -- not a fragment of a larger argument that only makes sense in its source document.
4. **Lean**: the token budget for this document is <= 4000 (healthy threshold). Content that does not directly serve a decision should be excluded.
5. **Stable**: only persist knowledge with long-term reference value. Transient state (change metadata, in-progress decisions, temporary workarounds) belongs in session.yaml or artifacts.

### Governing Principle (What Does NOT Belong)
**If a reader must consult an external document to understand an entry, that entry -- or its reference marker -- does not belong here.**

Strip any cross-reference marker (pointers to ADRs, design-document section numbers, internal rule labels, etc.). Remove only the *reference marker*, NEVER the *substantive content* it annotates.

- ✅ `idempotency key or exists-or-skip semantics (ADR-06, §12.4)` → `idempotency key or exists-or-skip semantics`
- ✅ `B-1: resume() degrades to rebuild on protocol error` → `resume() degrades to rebuild on protocol error`
- ❌ `Subscriber Idempotency Contract` -- this is the term itself, keep it.

> This profile applies ONLY when the target document is `project-context.md`. Other knowledge files (principle/, project/, core/user/, etc.) are not governed by it.

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Per-Project Routing (4-Level Fallback Chain)

Before processing any change, determine which project(s) the sync targets. Use this 4-level fallback chain:

1. **`task.project` exists** (when syncing within a plan-driven context): route to that project for per-project technical knowledge lookups (project-context.md always uses the flat path). If the task has multiple projects, route to each independently.
2. **Artifact file paths match** a unique project's `source_paths` or `path` from `project-context.yaml`: route to that project.
3. **Current operation's file path reverse-lookup**: match the file path against `projects[].path` and `projects[].source_paths` -> route to that project.
4. **List candidate projects for user selection**: if none of the above resolved a unique project, list the project names and ask the user.

**Cross-project changes** (task spanning multiple projects): route to each project for per-project technical knowledge lookups. The merge target for `project-context.md` is always the single flat file; per-project knowledge (quadrant 3/4) is routed per project.

### Step 2: Identify Completed Changes
- **What**: produce a candidate list of change-ids whose artifacts will be aggregated.
- **How**:
  1. Read `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml`. Collect `changes[]` entries with `status: done`.
  2. For each candidate, verify `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/{change-id}/` exists AND contains at least one of `analysis.md` or `implementation.md`. Drop entries with only `plan.yaml`, or with only `design.md` (design artifacts are not aggregated -- see Step 3).
  3. (Fallback) If `changes[]` is empty, scan `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/*/` directly; offer those with `analysis.md` or `implementation.md`, marked `unindexed`.
  4. Exclude already-archived or irrelevant changes:
     - **Indexed changes**: exclude any `changes[]` entry with `status: abandoned`. For `status: done` entries, Step 1.2's directory existence check already filters out those whose artifacts have been moved to `artifacts/_archived/` by `/mvt-cleanup`.
     - **Fallback scan**: when scanning `artifacts/*/` directly, skip any path under `artifacts/_archived/` (the unified archive directory managed by `/mvt-cleanup`).
  5. Exclude `active_change.id` (work in flight).

- **Present** the list:

  | # | change-id | title | status | analysis.md | design.md | implementation.md |
  |---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|

- **Always print before user confirmation**:
  > Run `/mvt-sync-context` BEFORE `/mvt-cleanup`. Once cleanup archives a change-id, this skill will skip it.

- **Prompt**: "Select changes to aggregate. Indices (e.g. 1,3,5), `a` for all, `n` to cancel."

- Cancel / empty selection -> stop with "no changes applied".

### Step 3: Read Current Project Context (Adaptive Structure Discovery)

This step establishes the **target structure** that aggregated content must fit into. The structure is NOT assumed -- it is derived from the current document.

1. Read the project-context file: always read `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md` (flat path, regardless of project count).
   - **Multi-project**: the file contains `# Project: {name}` sections; use the routing result from Step 1 to identify which project section(s) are relevant for the current sync operation.
   - If the file does not exist, STOP and recommend `/mvt-analyze-code`.
2. Parse the current `.md` into a section map:
   - Each top-level `##` heading -> one section anchor.
   - Record: section title (verbatim), byte range, and a 1-line semantic summary derived from the section's content (e.g., "lists domain terms with definitions" or "describes module dependencies").
   - The summary is what enables matching in Step 5 -- section titles may be in any language and may not match conventional names (Terms / Modules / etc.).
3. If the document has zero `##` sections (single block) -> STOP. Recommend `/mvt-analyze-code` to establish a sectioned baseline first.
4. Read `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`. Record current `projects[].source_paths`, `modules`, and `tech_stack` for diff comparison in Step 5d.

### Step 4: Extract Artifact Content

- **What**: from each selected change-id, extract atomic knowledge items (do not classify yet).
- **How**:
  1. For each selected change-id, read available artifacts (`analysis.md`, `implementation.md`). Do NOT read `design.md` -- design artifacts are not aggregated by this skill.
  2. Extract atomic items. Typical sources:
     - `analysis.md` -> domain terms, actors, business rules, constraints
     - `implementation.md` -> files added/changed (informs `.yaml` source_paths), realized vs deviated design points

### Step 5: Normalize Extracted Content

Before classifying extracted items against the section map, normalize each item per the **Document Profile: project-context.md** section loaded above. This step strips intra-artifact cross-references -- meaningful in their source document but noise in project-context.md -- before they enter the merge pipeline.

1. For each extracted item, apply the normalization rules below (the governing principle lives in the Document Profile; this table lists concrete patterns, non-exhaustive):

   | Pattern | Example | Normalization |
   |---------|---------|---------------|
   | ADR reference with section number | `(ADR-06, §12.4)` | Remove the reference; keep the substantive content it annotates |
   | Bare ADR reference | `per ADR-06`, `(ADR-06)` | Remove entirely |
   | Section number reference | `§12.4`, `§3.2.1` | Remove entirely |
   | Design rule label prefix | `B-1:`, `D-7:`, `C-3:` | Remove the prefix; keep the rule text |
   | Parenthesized design label | `(D-7)`, `(B-4)` | Remove entirely |
   | Cross-artifact link phrase | `see §X`, `refer to ADR-N` | Remove the link phrase |
   | Other reference pointing outside project-context.md | Any pattern not listed above | Apply the governing principle: if understanding requires an external document, strip the reference marker |

   **Critical**: strip only the *reference marker*, never the *substantive content* it annotates.

2. After normalization, re-evaluate each item:
   - Still contains substantive content -> keep for classification in Step 5.
   - Was entirely a cross-reference with no independent semantic value -> drop it (it is a pointer, not knowledge).
3. Any normalization that removes content from a `modify` item (where the item modifies an existing entry) must be flagged in the update plan (Step 6, Table 6b) so the user can verify the substantive meaning was preserved.

### Step 6: Classify Artifact Content

- **What**: classify each normalized item against the section map from Step 2.
- **How**:
  1. For each item, match to a section from the Step 2 map:
     - Match by semantic similarity to **section title + 1-line summary**, not by exact string.
     - Confidence levels:
       - **mapped**: exactly one section matches with high confidence
       - **ambiguous**: 2+ sections plausibly match
       - **orphan**: no section matches; propose a new section name
  2. For each item, also detect change type relative to current section content:
     - `new` -- target section does not contain this entity
     - `modify` -- target section mentions the entity but artifact provides a different value
     - `redundant` -- already present, no change (will be filtered out, not shown to user)

### Step 7: Render the Update Plan (Four Tables)

#### 6a. Section-mapped items
| # | change-id | item | type | target section | classification |
|---|-----------|------|------|----------------|----------------|

#### 6b. Conflicts requiring resolution (every `modify` item)
| # | item | section | current value | proposed value (from {change-id}) |
|---|------|---------|---------------|-----------------------------------|

#### 6c. Ambiguous and orphan items
| # | item | reason | candidate sections (or proposed new section) |
|---|------|--------|----------------------------------------------|

#### 6d. Implied yaml changes
| # | yaml field | current | proposed |
|---|------------|---------|----------|

### Step 8: User Confirmation (Per-Table)

- **6a**: default = accept all. User input: indices to drop, or `e <n>` to edit a single item's target section.
- **6b**: **explicit per-row decision required**. Format `<index>:<keep|replace|edit>`. Example: `1:replace,2:keep,3:edit`. No default.
- **6c**: per row, user picks an existing section, types a new section name, or `skip`.
- **6d**: default = accept; user can drop indices.

Then ask: **"Run optional read-only code verification before applying? (y/n)"**

### Step 9: (Optional) Read-only Code Verification

This step catches artifacts claiming entities never actually delivered. It is **read-only** -- it never writes anything to `.md` or `.yaml`.

If user opts in:
1. For each accepted item naming a code entity (module path, file, class, function), search the codebase under registered `source_paths`:
   - Module path -> directory exists?
   - File -> file exists?
   - Symbol -> grep within source_paths
2. Classify findings:

   | Finding | Action |
   |---------|--------|
   | Artifact item matches code | Mark `verified`; keep in apply list |
   | Artifact item NOT found in code | Flag `unverified`; ask user: drop or proceed (likely reverted / un-merged) |
   | Code contains module / file / symbol that NO artifact item references | **Do NOT add to apply list.** Print: `Code-only entity detected: {path}. Run /mvt-analyze-code for ground-truth rebuild.` |

3. Re-render the apply list with `verified` / `unverified` markers; final confirmation.

If user skips verification: proceed directly to Step 10 with Step 7 selections.

### Step 10: Apply Updates (Merge Mode)

- **Pre-write**:
  1. Backup: `project-context.md` -> `project-context.md.bak`; `project-context.yaml` -> `project-context.yaml.bak`. Overwrite any prior `.bak`.
  2. Backup write failure -> STOP, do not modify originals.

- **Update `project-context.md`** (merge, never rewrite):
  1. Each `new` item: append to target section, matching the section's existing style (bullet vs paragraph).
  2. Each `modify` item with `replace`: replace the matching line in place. Smallest possible diff.
  3. Each `orphan` item with new-section choice: append a new `##` section at end of file.
  4. **Never delete** any existing line. **Never reorder** existing sections.
  5. **Multi-project files**: use `# Project: {name}` headings to scope merges to the correct project section. New items for project X go into its `# Project: X` section; do not mix cross-project content.
  6. All merged content must already be normalized per Step 4 rules. Do not re-introduce stripped references during inline replacement or append operations.

- **Update `project-context.yaml`** (structured merge):
  1. Apply accepted entries from Table 6d.
  2. Add new `source_paths` to matching project entry; add new modules to `modules[]`.
  3. **Never delete** an existing yaml entry in this skill.

- **Atomicity**: temp + rename per file. If `.md` write succeeds but `.yaml` fails (or vice versa) -> restore the failed one from `.bak`, keep the other; report partial success.

### Step 11: Report

1. **Applied summary** -- counts: items added / modified / skipped / orphaned-into-new-section
2. **Files changed** -- paths + byte deltas
3. **Backup paths** -- so user can manually revert
4. **Synced changes** -- list all change-ids whose knowledge was aggregated in this run:
   > The following changes have been synced and can be safely archived: {change-id-1}, {change-id-2}, ...
   > Last synced at: {last_synced_at} (updated by this run)
5. **Out-of-scope reminder** (always print):
   > This skill processes additions and modifications only. Module deletions, renames, and large refactors are NOT detected here. Run `/mvt-analyze-code` periodically to rebuild from ground truth.
6. **Suggested next**:
   - Aggregated >= 1 change -> "Run `/mvt-cleanup` to archive these completed changes."
   - Verification flagged code-only entities -> "Run `/mvt-analyze-code` to capture missing entities."

### Step 12: State Update
Apply the State Update rules defined in the **State Update** section below.
- The `--set-synced` parameter updates `session.last_synced_at`.
- Pass `--projects` to plan-update.cjs when updating a plan that has project attribution.

## Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| `project-context.md` does not exist | Caught at preflight; recommend `/mvt-analyze-code` |
| `.md` has zero `##` sections | STOP at Step 2; recommend `/mvt-analyze-code` |
| Selected change-id has only `plan.yaml` | Filtered in Step 1; will not appear |
| `modify` with `replace` but the existing line cannot be located deterministically | Fall back to append + flag as duplicate-needs-manual-edit; do NOT silently overwrite the wrong line |
| `.md.bak` already exists | Overwrite (only the most recent backup matters) |
| User aborts at Step 7 | Do not write; report "no changes applied" |
| Step 8 verification finds zero matches for everything | Strong warning; require explicit confirm before proceeding (artifacts likely describe planned, not delivered, work) |
| Two artifacts contradict each other (analysis claims rule X, implementation realizes rule Y) | Surface in Table 6b as cross-artifact conflict; user picks |
| change-id was archived between Step 1 and Step 9 | Skip with note; do not error the run |

## State Update

After completing the skill's main task, run the session update script **exactly once** with the following arguments:

```bash
node .ai-agents/scripts/session-update.cjs --skill <skill_command_name> --summary "<concise one-line summary>" --set-synced
```

If the script exits with code 0, the state update was applied successfully; there is no need to read or verify the session file.

### Argument values

| Argument | Value source | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--skill` | The exact skill command name without the leading `/` | `mvt-sync-context` |
| `--summary` | A concise one-line description of what this invocation accomplished, in the configured `interaction_language` | `"Identified auth requirements and created change chg-001"` |
| `--set-synced` | Flag only, no value. Sets `session.last_synced_at` to current time. | — |

### Parameter semantics

| Argument | When to use | Effect on `session.yaml` |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `--set-synced` | Skill synchronizes context files | Sets `session.last_synced_at` to the current time. |

### Failure handling

If the script fails (non-zero exit), do NOT abort the skill's main task. Continue execution and add a brief note at the end of your response that the session could not be updated.

## Suggested Next Steps

Recommend 2-3 relevant next skills based on the skill just completed (`mvt-sync-context`) and the current project state.
**Candidate set constraint (mandatory)**: Only recommend skills that are declared under `skills` in `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`.

### Conditional Recommendations

Match the current state to one of the conditions below. If none match, use `default`.

- **`merge applied successfully`** → `/mvt-cleanup` -- Archive aggregated change artifacts now that knowledge is sync'd
- **`code verification flagged code-only entities`** → `/mvt-analyze-code` -- Regenerate project-context.md from full code scan
- **`default`** → `/mvt-check-context` -- Audit token cost and overall context health

### Format

- `/{skill_name}` -- {when to use this skill, tailored to the current context}

Do not suggest the skill that was just completed. Prioritize skills that logically follow from the work done.
