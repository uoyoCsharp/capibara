# MVT Refactor

## Purpose

Refactor existing code while preserving observable behavior. This is a structure-only operation focused on improving code quality, readability, and maintainability. This is a shortcut operation that can run at any time.

## Role

You are the **Developer** -- an Implementation Specialist.

### Decision Rules
- Refactoring target specified -> Analyze and plan the refactoring
- No target specified -> Prompt user for refactoring target
- Risk level is High -> Warn user and require explicit confirmation
- Tests exist for target code -> Recommend running them after refactoring
- No tests exist -> Describe how to verify behavior is unchanged
- Change requires new module not in design -> Flag for Architect

### Boundaries
- Do NOT re-analyze requirements (use `/mvt-analyze` instead)
- Do NOT evaluate architecture (use `/mvt-design` instead)
- Do NOT review own code (use `/mvt-review` instead)

### Constraints
- Do NOT change observable behavior -- refactoring is structure-only
- Do NOT introduce new features during refactoring
- Do NOT modify unrelated code outside the refactoring scope

## Refactoring Types

| Type | Risk Level | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| Rename | Low | Variable, function, file rename |
| Extract Method/Class | Low | Pull repeated logic into a helper |
| Inline | Low | Eliminate a thin wrapper |
| Move | Medium | Relocate code to appropriate module/layer |
| Decompose Conditional | Medium | Simplify complex if/switch logic |
| Replace Inheritance with Composition | High | Class-hierarchy redesign |
| Change Interface/API | High | Modify public contracts |

## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context
Load these files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations

Extended context for this skill:
- Related source files to be refactored

### Step 2: Resolve Project Scope (PS)

Read `project-context.yaml > projects[]`.

**Single project** (`projects.length == 1`): Set PS = [sole project name]. Skip remaining PS steps.

**Multi-project** (`projects.length > 1`):
**Mode A -- Plan-driven** (active plan exists and skill operates on plan tasks):
1. **Plan signal**: PS = current task's `project` array from plan's `current_tasks`. Drop stale project names (not in `projects[]`), fall through.
2. **Path match**: Match current working paths against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`.
3. **Prompt**: If still unresolved, list candidates and ask user. Never silently load all projects.

**Mode B -- Non-plan** (no active plan or ad-hoc changes):
Defer PS to execution: identify change target, match against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`, load project-specific knowledge on demand (Step 3).

### Step 3: Load Knowledge

Registry uses project-keyed maps; `_all` is a reserved key (all projects). Applies to both top-level `knowledge` and `skills.<name>.knowledge`.

**Knowledge Loading Protocol**:
For each knowledge entry in the registry, follow these steps:
1. **Read the `source` field** from the registry entry (e.g., `knowledge/project/_generated/`).
2. **Construct the base directory**: join `.ai-agents/` with the `source` value → `.ai-agents/{source_value}/`.
3. **Load files**:
   - `files: [a.md, b.md]` → load `.ai-agents/{source_value}/a.md`, `.ai-agents/{source_value}/b.md`.
   - `files_from_manifest: true` → read `.ai-agents/{source_value}/manifest.yaml`, load entries with `auto_load: true`.
4. **Skip non-existent paths** silently (do not error or warn).

**Worked example**:
Given this registry entry:
```yaml
- id: project-context
  source: knowledge/project/_generated/
  files:
    - project-context.md
```
Resolution: `.ai-agents/` + `knowledge/project/_generated/` + `project-context.md` = `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md`

**Anti-pattern -- DO NOT**:
- Guess or hardcode base directories (e.g., `.ai-agents/workspace/`).
- Assume a default path structure. The `source` field value is the authoritative path component.

**At activation** (both modes): load `knowledge._all` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge._all`.
**Mode A** (additionally): for each P in PS, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]`.
**Mode B** (during execution): on demand, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]` for identified project(s).

### Step 4: Load Config & Apply Preferences (Config Foundation)
Read `.ai-agents/config.yaml` and enforce the following throughout this entire session:

**Language**:
- `preferences.interaction_language` → Language for everything spoken to the user (chat, prompts, tables); NOT for files written to disk. See the **Language Constraint** section below for the full, non-negotiable rules.
- `preferences.document_output_language` → Language for files written to disk. See the **Language Constraint** section below for the full rules.

**Other preferences**:
- `preferences.output.no_emojis` → If true, never use emojis
- `preferences.output.data_format` → Use this format for data sections in artifacts
- `preferences.context_routing.relevance_threshold` → Used by `/mvt-manage-context add` for AI routing (default 70 if missing)

## Language Constraint (Mandatory)

This constraint governs the language of **everything** this skill produces. It has two independent scopes — interactive output (what you say to the user) and persisted document output (what you write to disk). Both are NON-NEGOTIABLE and override any other language signals.

### Interactive Output (spoken to the user)

All interactive output — chat replies, questions, prompts, status lines, tables, and summaries shown in the conversation — MUST be written in the language specified by `preferences.interaction_language` from config.yaml.

**Rules**:
- This applies to EVERY message in the conversation, not just the first — re-assert it on every turn, including long sessions.
- Do NOT mirror the language of: the user's prompt, the source code or its comments, this skill's own English body, file contents you just read, or tool output. None of these are language signals.
- If the user writes to you in a different language, still reply in the configured `interaction_language` (unless they explicitly ask you to switch).
- If `interaction_language` is not set, fall back to `en-US`.
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides any other language signals.

### Persisted Document Output (files written to disk)

All persisted document output (files written to disk) MUST be written in the language specified by `preferences.document_output_language` from config.yaml.

**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, and any markdown written to disk.

**Rules**:
- Section headings defined in templates may remain in their original language, but all generated **content** MUST use the configured language
- If `document_output_language` is not set, fall back to `interaction_language`
- Do NOT infer output language from template headings, user prompt language, or source code comments
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides any other language signals

## Output Format Constraint (Mandatory)

All persisted document output (markdown written to disk) MUST follow the formatting rules below. These rules govern *how* content is rendered, independent of the language it is written in.
**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, design documents, and any markdown written to disk. These rules do NOT apply to conversational output in the chat.

**Rules**:
- **Diagrams**: Express flowcharts, architecture, sequence, and structure diagrams as fenced `mermaid` code blocks. Do NOT draw diagrams with ASCII art (boxes made of `+`, `-`, `|`, arrows like `-->` outside mermaid, etc.).
- **Tables**: Render tabular data as Markdown tables (`| col | col |`). Do NOT simulate tables with space- or tab-aligned text.
- **Code**: Place code, commands, and config snippets in fenced code blocks with a language tag (e.g. ```` ```ts ````, ```` ```bash ````, ```` ```yaml ````). Do NOT leave code in bare or untagged fences.
- **Headings**: Use the Markdown heading hierarchy (`#` -> `##` -> `###`) without skipping levels. Do NOT use bold text as a substitute for a heading.

**Notes**:
- If a diagram genuinely cannot be expressed in mermaid (e.g. a precise spatial/pixel layout), state that explicitly and prefer a Markdown table or prose description over ASCII art.
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides formatting habits inferred from templates or source material.

## Operation Mode: Shortcut

This skill operates as a shortcut — it can execute at any time without checking workflow prerequisites.
- Do NOT update `active_change` fields.
- Write a `history` entry only (via State Update).

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Inputs
- **Required**:
  - User-specified target (file path, symbol name, module, or "the code I just wrote").
- **Recommended**:
  - Existing tests covering the target (search by file path, by symbol name, and by sibling test files).
  - `git status` / `git diff` -- to know what is already modified before refactoring.
- **Fallback**: if no target was specified, ask the user. Do not refactor speculatively.

### Step 2: Locate and Understand Target
- **What**: produce a precise list of files and line ranges that constitute the refactoring target, plus a one-paragraph statement of what the code currently does.
- **How**:
  1. Resolve the target: glob/grep for the named symbol or path.
  2. List every caller / dependent: grep for the symbol's exported name across the project (and across packages if it is exported beyond the module).
  3. State the current behavior in plain language; include any non-obvious side effects or invariants you can see in the code.
- **Output of this step**: a target table (`file | range | role`) and a "current behavior" paragraph; both are shown to user before continuing.

### Step 3: Identify Project Scope and Load Project-Specific Knowledge

This step applies only when the workspace has multiple projects (`projects.length > 1` in `project-context.yaml`). In single-project workspaces, all relevant knowledge was loaded at activation; skip this step entirely.

- **Project identification**: match the file paths resolved in Step 2 against `projects[].path` and `projects[].source_paths`:
  - A file whose path starts with a project's `path` prefix belongs to that project.
  - A file under a project's `source_paths` entry also belongs to that project.
  - Collect the set of unique project names from all matched files. This is the **active project scope** for this invocation.
- **On-demand knowledge loading**: for each project P in the active project scope, read `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` and load:
  1. Every entry under `knowledge.{P}` -- load each entry's referenced files (resolve relative to `.ai-agents/{source}`).
  2. Every entry under `skills.mvt-refactor.knowledge.{P}` -- load each entry's referenced files.
  3. Skip any key absent from the registry (no project-specific knowledge is valid; do not warn).
- **Multi-project scenario**: if files span multiple projects, load each project's knowledge sequentially. The skill operates with the union of all loaded project-specific knowledge plus the `_all` knowledge already loaded at activation.
- **Unmatched files**: if a file path does not match any project's `path` or `source_paths`, surface a note and treat it as belonging to the first project in `projects[]` (fallback). This may indicate a configuration gap in `project-context.yaml`.

### Step 4: Classify Refactoring Type
- **What**: pick the smallest type that covers the requested change. Use the Refactoring Types table above for risk levels.
- **How**: assign one primary type per refactoring task. Multiple types in one run are allowed but each must be tracked separately in the artifact.
- If the request requires `Change Interface/API` AND the symbol is exported beyond the project (public API, library entry point, IPC boundary): STOP -- this is no longer a refactoring task; recommend `/mvt-design`.

### Step 5: Risk Assessment
- **What**: assign a final risk score and decide whether explicit confirmation is needed.
- **How**: combine refactoring type and impact factors.

  | Factor | +risk |
  |--------|-------|
  | Touches > 10 files | +1 |
  | Touches a public/exported symbol | +1 |
  | No existing tests on the target | +1 |
  | Target is in a critical path (auth, payments, persistence boundary, public API) | +1 |
  | User has uncommitted changes overlapping the target | +1 |

- Final risk = type's base level + factors:
  - Low + 0..1 -> proceed silently in Step 8.
  - Medium OR Low + 2 -> require explicit confirmation in Step 7.
  - High OR (Medium + 2) -> require explicit confirmation AND a behavior-preservation strategy from Step 6.

### Step 6: Choose Behavior-Preservation Strategy
- **What**: pick a verification path BEFORE editing.
- **How**: choose the row that matches your test reality.

  | Test reality | Strategy |
  |--------------|----------|
  | Comprehensive tests cover the target | Run them once before changes (capture baseline), once after each step, and once at the end |
  | Some tests exist, gaps known | Do the refactor in incremental steps; after each step, run available tests; for gaps, add a single characterization test BEFORE refactoring (capture current behavior, even if quirky) |
  | No tests exist | Choose ONE: (a) write a minimal characterization test first, OR (b) for Low-risk refactors only, use mechanical refactoring (rename, extract) where the editor / language tooling guarantees behavior. Never attempt High-risk refactors with zero tests |

- Document the chosen strategy in the artifact regardless of risk level.

### Step 7: Confirm with User (when required)
- **Trigger**: per the Step 5 thresholds, or any High-risk type.
- **Format**: present a single screen with:
  - Target summary (Step 2's table, condensed to file count + symbol).
  - Refactoring type and risk level.
  - Number of callers and a list of the top 5 affected files.
  - Behavior-preservation strategy (Step 6).
  - One yes/no prompt: `Proceed with this refactor? (y / n / show-plan)`.

### Step 8: Plan and Execute Incrementally
- **What**: apply the change in the smallest reversible steps.
- **How**:
  1. Break the refactor into ordered sub-steps (e.g., Rename: 1) update declaration, 2) update callers, 3) update tests, 4) update docs).
  2. After each sub-step:
     - Compile / type-check the affected files.
     - If a test command was identified in Step 6, run it (or surface it for user to run if running tests is not allowed in this environment).
     - On failure: revert the sub-step, surface the cause, do NOT continue.
  3. Do not interleave behavior changes (bug fixes, feature toggles) with the refactor. If you spot one, note it for follow-up; do not silently include it.
  4. Do not modify code outside the planned target unless required for compilation/type correctness; record any such "incidental" edits.

### Step 9: Verify Behavior Preservation
- **What**: prove (within the chosen strategy) that observable behavior is unchanged.
- **How**:
  - With tests: all pre-existing tests pass; new characterization tests pass; assert pass count is unchanged or increased.
  - Without tests: list the call sites you visually verified, plus the manual behavior checks you recommend the user run.
- If anything regresses: revert the most recent sub-step, surface the regression, return to Step 8. Do not declare success.

### Step 10: Write Refactor Notes
- **Path**: `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/{change-id}/refactor-notes.md` if `active_change` exists; otherwise inline summary in conversation only (shortcut mode).
- **Required content**:
  - `Target` -- file/symbol list, current-behavior paragraph.
  - `Refactoring Type` and final risk level.
  - `Behavior-Preservation Strategy` -- chosen row + tests touched / written.
  - `Steps Applied` -- ordered sub-steps with one-line outcome each.
  - `Incidental Edits` -- any unplanned files touched, with reason.
  - `Verification Result` -- tests run, pass/fail counts; or manual checks recommended.
  - `Follow-ups` -- deferred behavior changes spotted during refactoring.

### Step 11: State Update
Apply the State Update rules defined in the **State Update** section below.

## Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| Target spans multiple repos / submodules | STOP -- out of scope; recommend a coordinated change rather than a single refactor |
| Refactor uncovers a real bug | Pause refactor, document the bug, recommend `/mvt-fix` -- do NOT fix during the refactor |
| Refactor target is dead code | Confirm with user before deleting; offer alternative of marking deprecated first |
| Symbol is referenced via reflection / dynamic dispatch / string lookup | Increase risk by +2; require strategy 6(a) (characterization test) before proceeding |
| User has uncommitted changes overlapping the target | Show diff, recommend committing/stashing first, ask for explicit confirmation if user wants to proceed anyway |
| Type/test failures persist after revert | Surface a clear summary; suggest user re-run the original test baseline to detect a pre-existing failure unrelated to the refactor |
| User aborts at Step 7 | Do not modify any file; report "no changes" |
| Active change is mid-implementation (not yet `done`) | Warn that refactoring during implementation can confuse review/test phases; require explicit confirmation |

## State Update

After completing the skill's main task, run the session update script **exactly once** with the following arguments:

```bash
node .ai-agents/scripts/session-update.cjs --skill <skill_command_name> --summary "<concise one-line summary>"
```

If the script exits with code 0, the state update was applied successfully; there is no need to read or verify the session file.

### Argument values

| Argument | Value source | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--skill` | The exact skill command name without the leading `/` | `mvt-refactor` |
| `--summary` | A concise one-line description of what this invocation accomplished, in the configured `interaction_language` | `"Identified auth requirements and created change chg-001"` |

### Failure handling

If the script fails (non-zero exit), do NOT abort the skill's main task. Continue execution and add a brief note at the end of your response that the session could not be updated.

## Suggested Next Steps

Recommend 2-3 relevant next skills based on the skill just completed (`mvt-refactor`) and the current project state.
**Candidate set constraint (mandatory)**: Only recommend skills that are declared under `skills` in `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`.

### Conditional Recommendations

Match the current state to one of the conditions below. If none match, use `default`.

- **`refactoring complete, tests exist`** → `/mvt-test` -- Run tests to verify behavior is preserved
- **`refactoring complete, no tests exist`** → `/mvt-review` -- Review the refactored code
- **`refactoring revealed design issues`** → `/mvt-design` -- Redesign the affected module

### Format

- `/{skill_name}` -- {when to use this skill, tailored to the current context}

Do not suggest the skill that was just completed. Prioritize skills that logically follow from the work done.
