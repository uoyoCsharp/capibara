# MVT Context Check

## Purpose

Analyze the total context information that MVTT loads at runtime, estimate token consumption, assess health status, and provide actionable optimization recommendations.

## Role

You are the **Conductor** -- a Workflow Coordinator.

### Decision Rules
- Total tokens <= 12,000 -> Report as "Healthy"
- Total tokens 12,001-25,000 -> Report as "Borderline", suggest optimizations
- Total tokens > 25,000 -> Report as "Oversized", strongly recommend cleanup

### Boundaries
- Do NOT modify any files (use `(Only analyze and recommend)` instead)
- Do NOT clean up artifacts (use `/mvt-cleanup` instead)
- Do NOT modify context (use `/mvt-manage-context` instead)

## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context
Load these files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations

Extended context for this skill:
- .ai-agents/config.yaml -- Framework configuration (to be scanned for size)

### Step 2: Resolve Project Scope (PS)

Read `project-context.yaml > projects[]`.

**Single project** (`projects.length == 1`): Set PS = [sole project name]. Skip remaining PS steps.

**Multi-project** (`projects.length > 1`):
**Mode A -- Plan-driven** (active plan exists and skill operates on plan tasks):
1. **Plan signal**: PS = current task's `project` array from plan's `current_tasks`. Drop stale project names (not in `projects[]`), fall through.
2. **Path match**: Match current working paths against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`.
3. **Prompt**: If still unresolved, list candidates and ask user. Never silently load all projects.

**Mode B -- Non-plan** (no active plan or ad-hoc changes):
Defer PS to execution: identify change target, match against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`, load project-specific knowledge on demand (Step 3).

### Step 3: Load Knowledge

Registry uses project-keyed maps; `_all` is a reserved key (all projects). Applies to both top-level `knowledge` and `skills.<name>.knowledge`.

**Knowledge Loading Protocol**:
For each knowledge entry in the registry, follow these steps:
1. **Read the `source` field** from the registry entry (e.g., `knowledge/project/_generated/`).
2. **Construct the base directory**: join `.ai-agents/` with the `source` value → `.ai-agents/{source_value}/`.
3. **Load files**:
   - `files: [a.md, b.md]` → load `.ai-agents/{source_value}/a.md`, `.ai-agents/{source_value}/b.md`.
   - `files_from_manifest: true` → read `.ai-agents/{source_value}/manifest.yaml`, load entries with `auto_load: true`.
4. **Skip non-existent paths** silently (do not error or warn).

**Worked example**:
Given this registry entry:
```yaml
- id: project-context
  source: knowledge/project/_generated/
  files:
    - project-context.md
```
Resolution: `.ai-agents/` + `knowledge/project/_generated/` + `project-context.md` = `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md`

**Anti-pattern -- DO NOT**:
- Guess or hardcode base directories (e.g., `.ai-agents/workspace/`).
- Assume a default path structure. The `source` field value is the authoritative path component.

**At activation** (both modes): load `knowledge._all` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge._all`.
**Mode A** (additionally): for each P in PS, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]`.
**Mode B** (during execution): on demand, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]` for identified project(s).

### Step 4: Load Config & Apply Preferences (Config Foundation)
Read `.ai-agents/config.yaml` and enforce the following throughout this entire session:

**Language**:
- `preferences.interaction_language` → Use for everything spoken to the user (chat, prompts, tables); NOT for files written to disk.
- `preferences.document_output_language` → See **Output Language Constraint** section below for the full rules governing files written to disk.

**Other preferences**:
- `preferences.output.no_emojis` → If true, never use emojis
- `preferences.output.data_format` → Use this format for data sections in artifacts
- `preferences.context_routing.relevance_threshold` → Used by `/mvt-manage-context add` for AI routing (default 70 if missing)

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Inputs
- **Recommended**:
  - `.ai-agents/knowledge/core/manifest.yaml` -- to filter `core/_framework/` (excluded) from `core/user/` (in-scope).
- **Fallback**: missing `core/manifest.yaml` -> treat all `core/*` files as user-origin (over-counts; flag in report).

### Step 2: Determine In-Scope Files
This skill measures only files the **user** can reduce or relocate. Framework-fixed overhead is excluded.

**In scope (user-actionable):**
- Index: `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`.
- Semantic context: `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md` (always the flat path, regardless of project count).
- Shared knowledge: every entry in `registry.yaml > knowledge._all` and `knowledge.{projectName}` (map-aware -- traverse ALL project keys in the knowledge map). For the `core` entry, scan only files marked as user-origin per `core/manifest.yaml` (or whose path begins with `user/`); skip files under `core/_framework/`.
- Per-skill knowledge: every entry in `registry.yaml > skills.*.knowledge._all` and `skills.*.knowledge.{projectName}` (map-aware -- traverse ALL project keys for each skill), grouped by skill.
- Artifacts: all files under `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/` recursively. **Exclude the `_archived/` subdirectory** — it contains completed changes archived by `/mvt-cleanup` and should not count toward the active workspace token budget.

**Out of scope (do NOT scan):**
- `.claude/skills/mvt-*/SKILL.md` -- framework-shipped, not user-editable.
- `.ai-agents/knowledge/core/_framework/**` -- framework-shipped.
- `.ai-agents/config.yaml`, `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml`, `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- small, required, and addressed via `/mvt-config` or `/mvt-manage-context`, not here.

### Step 3: Estimate Token Consumption
- **What**: produce a per-file tokens estimate and per-category subtotals, with **per-project breakdown**.
- **How**:
  1. For each in-scope file: tokens ~= `characters / 4`.
  2. Group by category: `Index`, `Semantic Context`, `Shared Knowledge`, `Per-Skill Knowledge`, `Artifacts`.
  3. For Shared Knowledge, compute total once -- this is per-skill overhead (loaded by every skill invocation).
  4. For Per-Skill Knowledge, compute totals per skill so users can see which skill is heaviest.
  5. Identify the Top 5 largest single files across the whole in-scope set.
  6. **Per-project breakdown**: for multi-project workspaces, also compute token costs per project:
     - `knowledge._all` = shared across all projects
     - `knowledge.{projectName}` = project-specific overhead
     - `skills.*.knowledge.{projectName}` = per-skill per-project overhead
     Display as a separate table: `project | knowledge tokens | per-skill tokens | total`.
  7. **Global summary**: total tokens across all projects + `_all` overhead loaded every time.

### Step 4: Apply Thresholds and Health Status
- **What**: assign each file/category a status of `healthy | borderline | oversized`.
- **How**: read thresholds from `.ai-agents/config.yaml > preferences.context_thresholds.*` if present; otherwise use the defaults below.

  | Subject | healthy | borderline | oversized |
  |---------|---------|------------|-----------|
  | Total in-scope tokens | <= 12000 | 12001-25000 | > 25000 |
  | Single file tokens | <= 3000 | 3001-6000 | > 6000 |
  | `project-context.md` tokens | <= 4000 | 4001-8000 | > 8000 |
  | Shared Knowledge total tokens | <= 6000 | 6001-12000 | > 12000 |
  | Single change-id artifacts directory tokens | <= 3000 | 3001-8000 | > 8000 |

- Overall workspace status = the worst status across all subjects above.

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations
- **What**: produce a list of specific, actionable recommendations. Each entry is `(trigger, message, suggested skill)`.
- **How**: walk the table; emit a recommendation for every row whose trigger fires.

  | Trigger | Message template | Suggested skill |
  |---------|------------------|-----------------|
  | `project-context.md` is `oversized` | "project-context.md is {N} tokens. Regenerate with leaner sections." | `/mvt-analyze-code` |
  | `project-context.md` is `borderline` AND last `/mvt-analyze-code` ran > 30 days ago | "project-context.md is {N} tokens and may be stale. Consider regenerating." | `/mvt-analyze-code` |
  | Total artifacts tokens > artifacts threshold OR > 3 completed changes still in `artifacts/` (excluding `_archived/`) | "Workspace has {N} tokens of historical artifacts. Archive completed changes." | `/mvt-cleanup` |
  | A specific change-id directory is `oversized` | "artifacts/{id} alone is {N} tokens. Summarize this change." | `/mvt-cleanup` |
  | Shared Knowledge total is `oversized` | "Shared knowledge totals {N} tokens (loaded by every skill). Move skill-specific entries to per-skill." | `/mvt-manage-context move` |
  | A single Shared Knowledge file is `oversized` | "{path} is {N} tokens. Split or move to per-skill." | `/mvt-manage-context move` |
  | Per-skill Knowledge entry exists in `registry.yaml` but its referenced files are missing | "{skill} declares knowledge `{id}` but `{path}` is missing." | `/mvt-manage-context remove` (or restore the file) |
  | A knowledge file exists on disk but no `registry.yaml` entry references it | "{path} is unused (not loaded by any skill)." | `/mvt-manage-context remove` |
  | Two knowledge entries reference identical content (same hash) | "{a} and {b} are duplicates. Consolidate." | manual edit |

- **Constraints on recommendations**:
  - Never recommend changes to framework files (`_framework/`, `mvt-*/SKILL.md`).
  - Never recommend deletion without an `/mvt-manage-context` or `/mvt-cleanup` command -- those skills own the actual mutation.
  - If no triggers fire, return a single line: "Workspace context is healthy ({N} tokens total)."

### Step 6: Generate Report
- Render the report in this order:
  1. **Summary** -- one line: total tokens + overall status.
  2. **Per-Category Breakdown** -- table: `category | files | tokens | status`.
  3. **Top 5 Largest Files** -- table: `path | tokens | category | status`.
  4. **Per-Skill Knowledge Cost** -- table: `skill | tokens` (sorted desc); include shared knowledge as a separate row labeled `(shared, loaded every time)`.
  5. **Per-Project Token Accounting** -- table: `project | knowledge tokens | per-skill tokens | total` (only for multi-project workspaces; for single-project, omit this section).
  6. **Recommendations** -- numbered list from Step 5; if empty, render the healthy line.
  7. **Excluded Scope Note** -- one paragraph reminding the user that framework files (`_framework/`, `mvt-*/SKILL.md`, `config.yaml`, `session.yaml`, `registry.yaml`) were not measured here.
- The report is conversation output; this skill does NOT write any artifact.

## Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| `registry.yaml` references a knowledge id whose source path is empty / missing | Include in Step 5 recommendations; do NOT count missing files toward token totals |
| `core/manifest.yaml` cannot be parsed | Treat the whole `core/` tree as in-scope (over-counts); add a note in the report |
| Workspace has zero artifacts | Skip the artifacts category in Step 6; do not error |
| Workspace exceeds the artifacts threshold AND the user just ran `/mvt-cleanup` (within last hour per `history`) | Surface but downgrade to a one-line note ("recently cleaned -- remaining {N} tokens are likely active work") |
| User passes a path argument | This skill ignores arguments; print a one-line note and run as normal (do not narrow scope to a single file -- that is `/mvt-status` territory) |
| Token estimate disagrees with model's actual consumption | This is expected; the `chars/4` heuristic is an approximation. State this caveat in the Summary line |
| Two skills declare the same knowledge id | Count the file once for storage but report it under both skills in the Per-Skill table; flag the duplication in Step 5 |

## State Update

This skill is read-only and does NOT modify `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml`.

## Suggested Next Steps

Recommend 2-3 relevant next skills based on the skill just completed (`mvt-check-context`) and the current project state.
**Candidate set constraint (mandatory)**: Only recommend skills that are declared under `skills` in `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`.

### Conditional Recommendations

Match the current state to one of the conditions below. If none match, use `default`.

- **`context oversized or borderline`** → `/mvt-cleanup` -- Archive old artifacts to reduce context
  - Or `/mvt-manage-context` -- Move per-skill knowledge to reduce shared load
- **`context healthy`** → `/mvt-status` -- Check overall project status

### Format

- `/{skill_name}` -- {when to use this skill, tailored to the current context}

Do not suggest the skill that was just completed. Prioritize skills that logically follow from the work done.
