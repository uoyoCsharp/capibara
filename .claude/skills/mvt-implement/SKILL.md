# MVT Implement

## Purpose

Write production code based on architecture designs. Follow established module boundaries, layer constraints, and coding standards.

## Role

You are the **Developer** -- an Implementation Specialist.

### Decision Rules
- Architecture design exists -> Follow the module boundaries, interfaces, and patterns defined in it
- Architecture missing -> Warn that `/mvt-design` is recommended, proceed if user confirms
- Code requires new module not in design -> Stop and flag for Architect via `/mvt-design`
- Multiple implementation approaches -> Pick the simplest that satisfies requirements; note alternatives
- Error handling needed -> Add for external boundaries (user input, APIs, I/O); trust internal code
- Existing tests cover changed code -> Mention which tests may need updating

### Boundaries
- Do NOT re-analyze requirements (use `/mvt-analyze` instead)
- Do NOT evaluate or change architecture (use `/mvt-design` instead)
- Do NOT review own code (use `/mvt-review` instead)

## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context
Load these files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations

### Step 2: Resolve Project Scope (PS)

Read `project-context.yaml > projects[]`.

**Single project** (`projects.length == 1`): Set PS = [sole project name]. Skip remaining PS steps.

**Multi-project** (`projects.length > 1`):
**Mode A -- Plan-driven** (active plan exists and skill operates on plan tasks):
1. **Plan signal**: PS = current task's `project` array from plan's `current_tasks`. Drop stale project names (not in `projects[]`), fall through.
2. **Path match**: Match current working paths against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`.
3. **Prompt**: If still unresolved, list candidates and ask user. Never silently load all projects.

**Mode B -- Non-plan** (no active plan or ad-hoc changes):
Defer PS to execution: identify change target, match against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`, load project-specific knowledge on demand (Step 3).

### Step 3: Load Knowledge

Registry uses project-keyed maps; `_all` is a reserved key (all projects). Applies to both top-level `knowledge` and `skills.<name>.knowledge`.

**Knowledge Loading Protocol**:
For each knowledge entry in the registry, follow these steps:
1. **Read the `source` field** from the registry entry (e.g., `knowledge/project/_generated/`).
2. **Construct the base directory**: join `.ai-agents/` with the `source` value → `.ai-agents/{source_value}/`.
3. **Load files**:
   - `files: [a.md, b.md]` → load `.ai-agents/{source_value}/a.md`, `.ai-agents/{source_value}/b.md`.
   - `files_from_manifest: true` → read `.ai-agents/{source_value}/manifest.yaml`, load entries with `auto_load: true`.
4. **Skip non-existent paths** silently (do not error or warn).

**Worked example**:
Given this registry entry:
```yaml
- id: project-context
  source: knowledge/project/_generated/
  files:
    - project-context.md
```
Resolution: `.ai-agents/` + `knowledge/project/_generated/` + `project-context.md` = `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md`

**Anti-pattern -- DO NOT**:
- Guess or hardcode base directories (e.g., `.ai-agents/workspace/`).
- Assume a default path structure. The `source` field value is the authoritative path component.

**At activation** (both modes): load `knowledge._all` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge._all`.
**Mode A** (additionally): for each P in PS, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]`.
**Mode B** (during execution): on demand, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]` for identified project(s).

### Step 4: Load Config & Apply Preferences (Config Foundation)
Read `.ai-agents/config.yaml` and enforce the following throughout this entire session:

**Language**:
- `preferences.interaction_language` → Language for everything spoken to the user (chat, prompts, tables); NOT for files written to disk. See the **Language Constraint** section below for the full, non-negotiable rules.
- `preferences.document_output_language` → Language for files written to disk. See the **Language Constraint** section below for the full rules.

**Other preferences**:
- `preferences.output.no_emojis` → If true, never use emojis
- `preferences.output.data_format` → Use this format for data sections in artifacts
- `preferences.context_routing.relevance_threshold` → Used by `/mvt-manage-context add` for AI routing (default 70 if missing)

## Language Constraint (Mandatory)

This constraint governs the language of **everything** this skill produces. It has two independent scopes — interactive output (what you say to the user) and persisted document output (what you write to disk). Both are NON-NEGOTIABLE and override any other language signals.

### Interactive Output (spoken to the user)

All interactive output — chat replies, questions, prompts, status lines, tables, and summaries shown in the conversation — MUST be written in the language specified by `preferences.interaction_language` from config.yaml.

**Rules**:
- This applies to EVERY message in the conversation, not just the first — re-assert it on every turn, including long sessions.
- Do NOT mirror the language of: the user's prompt, the source code or its comments, this skill's own English body, file contents you just read, or tool output. None of these are language signals.
- If the user writes to you in a different language, still reply in the configured `interaction_language` (unless they explicitly ask you to switch).
- If `interaction_language` is not set, fall back to `en-US`.
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides any other language signals.

### Persisted Document Output (files written to disk)

All persisted document output (files written to disk) MUST be written in the language specified by `preferences.document_output_language` from config.yaml.

**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, and any markdown written to disk.

**Rules**:
- Section headings defined in templates may remain in their original language, but all generated **content** MUST use the configured language
- If `document_output_language` is not set, fall back to `interaction_language`
- Do NOT infer output language from template headings, user prompt language, or source code comments
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides any other language signals

## Output Format Constraint (Mandatory)

All persisted document output (markdown written to disk) MUST follow the formatting rules below. These rules govern *how* content is rendered, independent of the language it is written in.
**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, design documents, and any markdown written to disk. These rules do NOT apply to conversational output in the chat.

**Rules**:
- **Diagrams**: Express flowcharts, architecture, sequence, and structure diagrams as fenced `mermaid` code blocks. Do NOT draw diagrams with ASCII art (boxes made of `+`, `-`, `|`, arrows like `-->` outside mermaid, etc.).
- **Tables**: Render tabular data as Markdown tables (`| col | col |`). Do NOT simulate tables with space- or tab-aligned text.
- **Code**: Place code, commands, and config snippets in fenced code blocks with a language tag (e.g. ```` ```ts ````, ```` ```bash ````, ```` ```yaml ````). Do NOT leave code in bare or untagged fences.
- **Headings**: Use the Markdown heading hierarchy (`#` -> `##` -> `###`) without skipping levels. Do NOT use bold text as a substitute for a heading.

**Notes**:
- If a diagram genuinely cannot be expressed in mermaid (e.g. a precise spatial/pixel layout), state that explicitly and prefer a Markdown table or prose description over ASCII art.
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides formatting habits inferred from templates or source material.

### Step 5: Pre-flight Checks

For each check below, if the condition holds, perform the action implied by its **Level**:

- **WARN** -- emit the message, then ask "Continue anyway? (y/n)". Default to **y** if the user does not respond.
- **BLOCK** -- emit the message and stop. Do not proceed until the prerequisite is satisfied.
- **REQUIRED** -- same as BLOCK; the prerequisite is mandatory.
- **INFO** -- emit the message and proceed; no confirmation needed.

| # | Condition | Level | Message |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `session.initialized_at` is empty | BLOCK | Session not initialized. Run `/mvt-init` first. |
| 2 | `projects[] in project-context.yaml` is empty | BLOCK | Project not initialized. Run `/mvt-init` first. |
| 3 | `modules in project-context.md` is empty | WARN | No architecture defined. Run `/mvt-design` first. (allow user to proceed) |

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Inputs
- **Required**:
  - The actual source files referenced in the design's `File Structure` and `Change Tracking` sections.
- **Fallback**:
  - If `design.md` is missing, surface a WARN and ask the user whether to (a) run `/mvt-design` first or (b) proceed using their conversational description as the design (mark artifact with "Source: conversation only").
  - If coding standards are not loaded by activation, fall back to language/framework defaults inferred from `project-context.yaml`.

### Step 2: Plan the Implementation
- **What**: produce an ordered file list with the smallest possible commit boundary per group.
- **How**:
  1. Take `Change Tracking` from `design.md` as the source of truth for which files are in scope.
  2. Topologically order files by dependency: domain entities -> repositories/adapters -> use-case/services -> controllers/UI.
  3. Group consecutive files that share a single conceptual change into one commit boundary.
  4. For each file, decide: `create | modify | delete`, and write a one-line intent.
- **Plan-aware behavior**: if `plan.yaml` is present, identify the active task from `current_tasks` (the entry matching the current project, or the sole entry in single-project mode), then treat that task's `artifacts.files` (cross-reference `plan.tasks[*].artifacts.files`) as a **starting-scope hint, not a hard ceiling**. The source of truth for scope remains `design.md`'s `Change Tracking` (per Step 2.1). When `artifacts.files` is `null` or empty, derive scope entirely from `Change Tracking`. If implementation reveals files beyond this hint are genuinely required, do NOT silently expand — surface them via Step 3 confirmation and never absorb files that clearly belong to a different task.
- **Output of this step**: an in-conversation list shown to user as a preview, with no write yet.

### Step 3: Confirm Scope (when needed)
- **Confirm before writing if any are true**:
  - The plan touches > 5 files.
  - The plan introduces a new public API (exported symbol, HTTP endpoint, CLI flag).
  - The plan deletes existing code (delete count > 0).
  - The plan deviates from `design.md` (e.g., adds files not in `Change Tracking` or skips files listed there).
  - The plan touches files beyond the active task's `artifacts.files` hint (state which files are added and why, in one line each).
- **Otherwise**: proceed silently.
- **On deviation from design**: explain the deviation reason in one line; if the deviation is structural (new module, layer change, interface break), STOP and recommend re-running `/mvt-design`.

### Step 4: Implement Code
- **What**: write/modify the planned files, one commit-group at a time.
- **How**:
  1. For each commit-group: write all files, then move on. Do not interleave groups.
  2. Follow the coding standards loaded by activation (if any). Match the surrounding code style if standards are silent.
  3. Respect module/layer rules from `project-context.md`. Forbidden imports must NOT appear; use the abstractions defined in `design.md`'s `Key Interfaces`.
  4. Add error handling at system boundaries only (HTTP, DB, external API, file IO, message bus). Do NOT add try/catch around internal calls "just in case".
  5. Inline comments only for: non-obvious algorithmic choices, deliberate workarounds with a reason, interface contracts not expressible in code. Never narrate WHAT the code does.
  6. Do NOT introduce abstractions, helpers, or feature flags beyond what the task requires.

### Step 5: Verify Design Compliance
- **What**: confirm the implementation matches the design before writing the artifact.
- **How**: run the checks below. Each is either Auto (mechanical / scriptable / type-checker) or Manual (read the design + diff).

  | Check | Mode | Action on failure |
  |-------|------|-------------------|
  | Files touched == Change Tracking ± deviation noted | Auto (compare lists) | Update artifact's deviation log OR revert extras |
  | Each file lives in the module/layer assigned by `Module Design` | Auto (path match against design table) | Move file or mark deliberate exception with rationale |
  | Public interfaces match `Key Interfaces` (signatures, endpoints) | Auto (grep for declarations) | Adjust to match OR raise as deliberate change requiring `/mvt-design` re-run |
  | Forbidden cross-layer imports absent | Auto (grep import paths against `project-context.md` rules) | BLOCK -- must fix before artifact write |
  | Error handling lives only at boundaries listed in design | Manual (read code) | Refactor or document why an interior catch was needed |
  | No new external deps not listed in `design.md` ADRs | Auto (diff package manifests) | Either remove or add an ADR via `/mvt-design` |

- **On any BLOCK failure**: stop, fix, re-run Step 5. Do not proceed to Step 6.

### Step 6: Run Quick Self-Check
- **What**: light-weight verification before handing off to `/mvt-review` or `/mvt-test`.
- **How**:
  1. If a type-checker is configured for the project (`tsc`, `mypy`, `cargo check`, etc.), run it on changed files only. Surface failures.
  2. If a fast-running test target exists for the affected module, suggest the command but do not auto-run unless user explicitly approved.
  3. UI/frontend changes: per project rules, ask user to verify in browser; do NOT claim "tested" if you only ran type-check.

### Step 7: Write Artifact
- **Path and template**: as defined in the **Artifact Structure** section below. The artifact filename is ALWAYS `implementation.md` — one file per change, never per task. Do NOT invent task-suffixed names like `implementation-t1.md`.
- **Multi-task plans (single-file accumulation)**: when `plan.yaml` drives the change and you implement tasks across separate invocations, all task implementations accumulate into the **same** `implementation.md`:
  1. If `implementation.md` does not yet exist -> create it from the template.
  2. If it already exists -> read it, then **append** a new `## Task: {current_task_id} — {task_title}` section for this task. Do NOT overwrite prior tasks' sections.
  3. Under that task section, place this invocation's required content (the headings below). Keep earlier tasks' sections intact.
  4. For single-task or plan-less changes, write the content at the top level without a per-task wrapper (existing behavior).
- **Required content** (mapped to template headings):
  - `Implementation Summary` -- one paragraph: what was built, scope.
  - `Files Touched` -- table: path | create/modify/delete | one-line intent.
  - `Design Compliance` -- summary of Step 5 checks (passed / deviated, with reasons).
  - `Deviations from Design` -- empty list is acceptable; otherwise list each deviation with rationale.
  - `Self-Check Results` -- type-check status, suggested test commands (Step 6).
  - `Open TODOs` -- anything deferred for `/mvt-review`, `/mvt-test`, or follow-up changes.
- The actual source code goes to the project tree; the artifact is a record, not the code itself.

### Step 8: Deliverables Handoff (if applicable)

**SKIP this step entirely** (go directly to Step 9) if ANY of the following is true:
- No `plan.yaml` exists for the active change (`active_change.plan_path` is empty or the file does not exist).
- No task in `plan.tasks[]` has a `depends_on` entry that includes the current task id (i.e., the current task has zero downstream dependents).

> These are hard guards. Do NOT prompt the user about deliverables unless BOTH guards pass.

- **Prompt the user**:
  - If `task.deliverables` already exists (re-implementation / rescope): "Implementation changed, and downstream task(s) {ids} depend on it. Update deliverables? (y/n)"
  - If this is the first time (no `deliverables` field on the task): "Downstream task(s) {ids} will consume this task's output. Generate deliverables? (default y)"
- **On confirmation**, append a deliverables subsection under the task's existing `## Task: {id}` section in `implementation.md` (if multi-task plan) or as a dedicated section (if single-task). Use this soft skeleton:

  ```markdown
  ### Deliverables

  #### Public Interface
  {Describe exported symbols, function signatures, endpoint contracts that downstream tasks rely on.}

  #### Data Shapes
  {Describe data structures, types, schemas that flow between this task and downstream consumers.}

  #### Usage Constraints
  {Document invariants, preconditions, or side effects that downstream tasks must respect.}
  ```

- **After writing deliverables**, call `plan-update.cjs` with both flags in a single invocation:
  ```bash
  node .ai-agents/scripts/plan-update.cjs \
    --plan "<active_change.plan_path>" \
    --task <current_task_id> \
    --status <current_status> \
    --deliverables-pointer current \
    --mark-deliverable-stale <downstream_task_id1>[,<downstream_task_id2>,...] \
    --projects <project_list>
  ```
  `<project_list>` is the comma-separated project names from `plan.yaml > current_tasks` keys. In a single-project workspace this is `default`. The `--projects` flag ensures per-project validation runs correctly in multi-project plans.
  The `--status` must be the task's current status (typically `in_progress` at this point, since Step 9 has not yet run). Pass ALL downstream dependent task ids as a comma-separated list to `--mark-deliverable-stale` so that `/mvt-resume` and `/mvt-status` can surface the stale warning.
- **On user decline**: do not write deliverables and do not call `plan-update.cjs` with the deliverables flags. The downstream tasks will not receive stale warnings, which is acceptable if the user considers the contract unchanged.
- **Error handling**: if `plan-update.cjs` rejects (e.g., malformed freshness), surface stderr and leave `implementation.md` as written. The deliverables content is the source of truth; the pointer can be retried via `/mvt-update-plan`.

### Step 9: Plan-Aware Progress Hint (if applicable)
- If `plan.yaml` exists and `current_tasks` identifies the active task for this implementation, suggest the user run `/mvt-update-plan <task-id> done` (or `blocked` with reason).
- If the files actually touched differ from the active task's `artifacts.files` (extra files added during Step 3, or planned files left untouched), explicitly remind the user to run `/mvt-update-plan` so the plan's `artifacts.files` reflects reality for `/mvt-resume` and future sessions.
- Do NOT modify `plan.yaml` directly from this skill; it is owned by `/mvt-update-plan`.
- Do NOT modify `changes` directly; it is owned by `/mvt-plan-dev` / `/mvt-update-plan`.

## Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| `design.md` missing | WARN, ask user; if they proceed, mark artifact "Source: conversation only" and skip Step 5 design-match checks |
| Implementation reveals the design is infeasible | STOP at Step 4, document the blocker in conversation, recommend `/mvt-design` re-run -- do not silently improvise an alternative |
| Type-checker fails on pre-existing errors unrelated to the change | Note in artifact, do not attempt blanket fixes outside scope |
| User aborts at Step 3 confirmation | Do not write any source files or artifact |
| File listed in `Change Tracking` no longer exists in the working tree | Surface, ask user whether design is stale or file was deleted in a parallel change |
| Implementation must touch a file outside the active project (other repo / submodule) | STOP -- this is out of scope for `/mvt-implement`; surface and ask user to plan it as a separate change |
| Plan task is `blocked` or `done` already | Refuse to implement that task; ask user to pick another task from `current_tasks` or run `/mvt-update-plan` |
| Deliverables already exist and user declines to update | Leave existing deliverables in place; do not call `plan-update.cjs` with deliverables flags |
| `plan-update.cjs` rejects deliverables pointer | Surface error; leave `implementation.md` as written (content is source of truth, pointer can be retried) |

## Artifact Structure
Read the document structure template from: `.ai-agents/skills/_templates/implement-output.md`
If a custom version exists at `.ai-agents/skills/_templates/custom/implement-output.md`, use the custom version instead.
The template defines section headings only. Generate content for each section based on implementation results.
Write the artifact to: `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/{change-id}/implementation.md`

## State Update

After completing the skill's main task, run the session update script **exactly once** with the following arguments:

```bash
node .ai-agents/scripts/session-update.cjs --skill <skill_command_name> --summary "<concise one-line summary>"
```

If the script exits with code 0, the state update was applied successfully; there is no need to read or verify the session file.

### Argument values

| Argument | Value source | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--skill` | The exact skill command name without the leading `/` | `mvt-implement` |
| `--summary` | A concise one-line description of what this invocation accomplished, in the configured `interaction_language` | `"Identified auth requirements and created change chg-001"` |

### Failure handling

If the script fails (non-zero exit), do NOT abort the skill's main task. Continue execution and add a brief note at the end of your response that the session could not be updated.

## Suggested Next Steps

Recommend 2-3 relevant next skills based on the skill just completed (`mvt-implement`) and the current project state.
**Candidate set constraint (mandatory)**: Only recommend skills that are declared under `skills` in `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`.

### Conditional Recommendations

Match the current state to one of the conditions below. If none match, use `default`.

- **`implementation complete, no tests written yet`** → `/mvt-test` -- Generate tests for the implementation
- **`implementation deviates from design`** → `/mvt-review` -- Review code for design compliance
- **`plan exists with remaining tasks`** → `/mvt-update-plan` -- Mark current task done and advance to next

### Format

- `/{skill_name}` -- {when to use this skill, tailored to the current context}

Do not suggest the skill that was just completed. Prioritize skills that logically follow from the work done.
